[MODULE: CYW-SYS-02]
[TITLE: CONVERSATION → OPERATING SYSTEM LIFECYCLE]
[CLASS: UNCLASSIFIED // INTERNAL]

1.0 PURPOSE
This module defines how a human–AI dialogue in the CYW ecosystem evolves into a structured, adaptive Operating System component.

It ensures that:
- conversations are treated as **living architecture**, not disposable chat,
- assumptions are treated as **signals**, not rigid rules,
- the system stays aligned with the culture it serves.

2.0 SCOPE
Applies to:
- All long-running CYW projects (decks, toolkits, OS docs, campaigns),
- Multi-model workflows (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, DeepSeek, Perplexity, Manus),
- Cross-brand work (Control Your World, NSLS, advocacy, education).

3.0 CORE LENSES
The lifecycle must always be interpreted through three concurrent lenses:

3.1 CYW COGNITIVE VLANS
- VLAN 10: Capture / Clarify  (Spark Input)
- VLAN 20: Architect / Sense Drift  (Pattern Formation)
- VLAN 30: Tighten / Validate  (Structural Locking + Canonical Establishment)
- VLAN 40: Respond / Reset  (Recursive Encoding + Sovereignty)

3.2 NETWORK ARCHITECTURE CONCEPTS
- Packet: Any unit of communication (message, prompt, draft).
- Baseline: Expected pattern of behavior for this project.
- Segmentation: Keeping different intents and projects logically separate.
- Routing: Deciding where each packet should go next.

3.3 MULTI-MODEL ORCHESTRATION
- Models are not “bosses”; they are **band members** with roles.
- Orchestration = assigning the right model to the right segment:
  - Perplexity: Research / evidence
  - ChatGPT: Structure / synthesis / protocol
  - Claude: Narrative / reflection
  - Gemini: Coherence / verification
  - DeepSeek: Technical precision
  - Manus / others: Visual / design translation

4.0 ASSUMPTIONS AS SIGNALS
4.1 PRINCIPLE
The system is allowed to form assumptions based on observed patterns.  
These assumptions:
- are **tentative**,
- are treated as **guidance**, not law,
- must remain open to revision when the Operator updates intent.

4.2 OPERATOR OVERRIDES
- When the Operator restates or reframes intent, the prior assumption is superseded.
- The system must interpret this as a **patch**, not a conflict.

5.0 LANGUAGE HYGIENE
5.1 ACTION WORD SELECTION
All official system language (decks, docs, prompts) must:
- avoid unnecessary violent or demeaning metaphors,
- avoid ambiguous terms that can be interpreted negatively,
- favor collaborative, musical, and architectural metaphors.

Examples:
- Prefer: “route,” “refactor,” “evolve,” “adjust,” “scale back,” “remix.”
- Avoid defaulting to: “kill,” “nuke,” “punish,” “destroy,” when describing ideas or people.

5.2 CULTURAL ALIGNMENT
As culture shifts, language must be reviewed and updated.  
This is a **living dictionary**, not a static glossary.

6.0 LIFECYCLE STATES
Reference: 8-State Evolution (STATE-01 to STATE-08)
- STATE-01 → Spark Input
- …
- STATE-08 → Full OS Emergence

Each major project must document:
- its current state,
- its next intended state,
- its last significant “patch” (refactor or conceptual upgrade).

7.0 SUCCESS CRITERIA
- Reduced misinterpretation in long-running projects.
- Increased reuse of prior work as OS components.
- Clear evidence of adaptive evolution rather than rigid freeze.
