## 🎯 Fee Analysis Questions

For each fee you find, ask:

1. **Was it avoidable?**
   - Could you have prevented it?
   - Was it due to poor planning or oversight?

2. **What caused it?**
   - Timing issue (bill due before paycheck)?
   - Forgot about a payment?
   - Didn't know balance was low?

3. **Could you have prevented it?**
   - Set up low balance alert?
   - Better cash flow management?
   - Different account setup?

4. **Is it recurring?**
   - Does it happen every month?
   - Does it happen at same time each month?
   - Is there a pattern?

---

## 📊 Pattern Recognition

After recording all fees, look for patterns:

### Common Patterns:

**Pattern 1: Timing Issues**
- Fees always happen on certain dates
- Bills due before payday
- **Solution**: Adjust bill due dates or build buffer

**Pattern 2: Forgetting Payments**
- Fees from auto-pay you forgot about
- **Solution**: Set reminders, use calendar, track better

**Pattern 3: Low Balance**
- Account frequently runs low
- **Solution**: Build account buffer, use savings account

**Pattern 4: Monthly Fees**
- Paying monthly maintenance fees
- **Solution**: Switch to fee-free account or meet minimum balance requirements

**Pattern 5: ATM Fees**
- Frequently using out-of-network ATMs
- **Solution**: Use in-network ATMs, get cash back at stores, switch banks

## 🎯 Quick Calculation Examples

### Example 1: High NSF Fee Problem

```
NSF Fees found:
- January: 2 fees × $35 = $70
- February: 1 fee × $35 = $35
- March: 3 fees × $35 = $105
- April: 1 fee × $35 = $35
- May: 2 fees × $35 = $70
- June: 1 fee × $35 = $35
- July: 0 fees = $0
- August: 1 fee × $35 = $35
- September: 2 fees × $35 = $70
- October: 1 fee × $35 = $35
- November: 3 fees × $35 = $105
- December: 1 fee × $35 = $35

Total NSF Fees (12 months): $590
Average per month: $49.17
```

**Analysis**: This person is paying almost $50/month in NSF fees! A $500 buffer would prevent most of these.

### Example 2: Monthly Fee Problem

```
Monthly Maintenance Fee: $12/month
× 12 months = $144/year

Plus NSF fees: $200/year
Plus ATM fees: $36/year

Total: $380/year in avoidable fees
```

**Solution**: Switch to fee-free account, save $380/year!

## 🚨 Red Flags (High Fee Situations)

Watch out for these patterns:

- **Multiple NSF fees per month** - You need a buffer immediately
- **NSF fees on same dates** - Timing issue, needs fixing
- **Monthly maintenance fees** - Often avoidable with different account
- **Regular ATM fees** - Easy to eliminate
- **Fees totaling $300+/year** - Significant savings opportunity

---

## 📝 Next Steps After Recording

1. **Calculate Total Costs**: Add up all fees for 12 months
2. **Identify Patterns**: When do fees occur? Why?
3. **Set Prevention Goals**: "Eliminate all NSF fees" or "Reduce fees by 90%"
4. **Create Action Plan**:
   - Build account buffer (prevents NSF fees)
   - Set up low balance alerts
   - Switch to fee-free account (if applicable)
   - Use in-network ATMs only
   - Adjust bill timing
5. **Add to Budget Template**: Include in your budget audit
6. **Track Progress**: Re-check in 3-6 months to see improvement

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Do credit cards have NSF fees?**  
A: No, but they have late fees, over-limit fees, etc. Check credit card statements separately.

**Q: What if I can't find old statements?**  
A: Use what you have (even 3-6 months is useful). Contact bank for older statements if needed.

**Q: Should I include fees that were refunded?**  
A: Note them but don't count in total (since they were refunded). They still show a problem pattern.

**Q: What about business account fees?**  
A: Yes, include them. Track business and personal separately if helpful.

**Q: How do I prevent these fees in the future?**  
A: Build account buffer ($500-$1,000+), set up alerts, use fee-free accounts, better cash flow management.

**Q: My bank charges monthly fees but I can't avoid them. What do I do?**  
A: Include them in your budget as a fixed expense. But research if you can switch to a fee-free account or meet minimum balance requirements.

## 🎯 Success Metrics

Track these to measure improvement:

- **NSF fees per month**: Goal = 0
- **Total bank fees per month**: Goal = $0-5 (only unavoidable fees)
- **Annual fee cost**: Should decrease over time
- **Fee frequency**: Should decrease to zero

---

**Remember**: Even $30/month in fees = $360/year. That's money that could be in your account buffer preventing future fees! Recording these fees is the first step to eliminating them.
