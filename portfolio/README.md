## Featured Projects

### 1. Financial Budget Analysis System
**Keywords:** Financial Analysis, Python, Data Modeling, Risk Mitigation, NSF Prevention

A comprehensive budget analysis tool that processes financial data to identify cost-saving opportunities, predict cash flow issues, and prevent NSF fees through strategic buffer recommendations.

**Key Features:**
- Automated cash flow analysis (income vs. expenses)
- Subscription cost analysis with cancellation recommendations
- Account buffer calculations to prevent overdrafts
- NSF fee prevention planning
- Savings projections (monthly and annual)

**Technical Stack:**
- Python 3.9+
- JSON data processing
- Statistical calculations for buffer recommendations
- Report generation (text and structured output)

**Project Files:**
- `budget_analyzer.py` - Main analysis engine (~300 lines)
- `budget_data_template.json` - Data schema
- Comprehensive documentation and usage guides

**Results:**
- Identifies unused subscriptions (potential $79.98/month savings in example)
- Calculates optimal account buffers to prevent NSF fees
- Projects annual savings through data-driven recommendations

**Keywords:** Finite State Machines, Identity Systems, Cryptographic Security, System Architecture

Production-grade state management and decentralized identity (DID) systems with cryptographic integrity guarantees and audit trail generation.

**Key Features:**
- Event-driven state transitions with guard conditions
- Identity-first design with DID management
- Cryptographic integrity (Ed25519 signatures, canonical JSON)
- Multi-platform support (Python backend + Unity C# frontend)
- Comprehensive validation and testing

**Technical Stack:**
- Python 3.9+ (backend)
- C# / Unity (frontend integration)
- Cryptographic libraries (Ed25519)
- JSON canonicalization
- SQLite for state persistence

**Project Files:**
- `state_machine.py` - Main FSM engine (~460 lines)
- `identity_manager.py` - DID management (~440 lines)
- `servicepath_state_machine.py` - Service path workflows (~540 lines)
- Multiple test suites for validation

**Results:**
- Production-certified system (Virgil OS v1.0 Layer 3)
- Handles 13 states and 11 event types
- Cryptographic proof of state integrity
- ~7,300+ lines of production code
