## 💡 Pro Tips for Cancellation

### 1. Timing Matters
- **Cancel immediately** if unused - don't wait for "next month"
- **Cancel before renewal** if you have access until period ends
- **Check cancellation policy** - some require notice period

### 2. Retention Offers
- Many services offer discounts when you try to cancel
- Decide in advance: Is 50% off worth it? Or cancel completely?
- Common offers: "First month free", "50% off 3 months", "Annual plan discount"

### 3. Pause Instead of Cancel
- Some services offer "pause" option (Netflix, gyms)
- Good if you might return in a few months
- Preserves account/history while saving money

### 4. Downgrade Before Canceling
- Consider downgrading to free/basic tier
- Often keeps account active with limited features
- Can upgrade again later if needed

### 5. Share Subscriptions
- Family plans often cheaper per person
- Share with family/friends (Netflix, Spotify, etc.)
- Split costs to save everyone money

### 6. Annual vs Monthly
- If keeping service, annual often 20-40% cheaper
- Calculate: Monthly cost × 12 vs Annual cost
- Only switch if you're sure you'll use it all year
