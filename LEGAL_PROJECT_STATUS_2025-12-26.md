2. ✅ Crisis counseling session (Dec 26) - Professional intervention
3. ✅ Safety plan establishment (Dec 26) - Active treatment engagement
4. ⏳ Appointment confirmation (pending Dec 30 coordinator call)
5. ⏳ Provider letter (pending appointment + request)

**Legal Strategy:**
- Motion can proceed with D1-D3 (shows active crisis engagement)
- Provider letter can be supplemented when received
- Narrative: "Defendant actively engaged VA crisis services, awaiting formal provider documentation"

---

## Timeline Analysis

### Critical Dates
- **Today (Dec 26):** Court call (0930 EST) → Motion customization
- **Tomorrow (Dec 27):** Motion + Affidavit draft ready
- **Monday (Dec 30):** VA coordinator callback → Appointment scheduling
- **Jan 1-10:** Evidence finalization + provider letter collection
- **Jan 6-13:** FILING WINDOW (4 days before service deadline)
- **Jan 17:** Service deadline (court closed Jan 20)

### Timeline Compression Risk
**Issue:** Only 11 days from coordinator call (Dec 30) to provider letter needed (Jan 10)

**Mitigation:**
- Motion can be filed with current VA crisis documentation
- Provider letter submitted as supplement if delayed
- Alternative: Use D1-D3 as primary evidence, letter as enhancement

**Status:** 🟡 Manageable with backup plan

---

## Strategic Approach

### Primary Argument
1. **Medical Hardship:** PTSD crisis documented via VA contacts (Dec 25-26)
2. **Work Schedule Impossibility:** 60hrs/week overnight shifts
3. **Good Faith Efforts:** Suffolk application, PO contacts, VA crisis engagement
4. **Alternative Service Request:** Virtual, seated, flexible schedule

### Motion Language (Draft)
```
"On December 25, 2025, Defendant contacted VA Mental Health Crisis Services 
via the VA mobile app. On December 26, 2025, Defendant received crisis 
counseling and established a safety plan with VA crisis staff. Defendant 
has been referred to a VA Suicide Prevention Coordinator for follow-up 
appointment scheduling. Defendant will supplement this motion with formal 
provider documentation upon receipt from VA medical records.

- D1: VA app chat transcript (Dec 25, 2025)
- D2: Crisis counseling session notes (Dec 26, 2025)  
- D3: Safety plan establishment (Dec 26, 2025)
