## 📊 Quick Calculations

### Minimum Checking Account Buffer
```
Monthly Expenses × 1.75 = Recommended Buffer

Example: $3,000/month expenses = $5,250 buffer
```

### Emergency Fund Target
```
Monthly Expenses × 4.5 = Emergency Fund Goal

Example: $3,000/month expenses = $13,500 emergency fund
```

### Subscription Savings Potential
```
Unused Subscriptions = Immediate Monthly Savings

Example: Cancel 5 unused subscriptions @ $10 each = $50/month = $600/year
```
