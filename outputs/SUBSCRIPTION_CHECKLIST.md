## ✅ VERIFICATION CHECKLIST

After going through this list:

- [ ] Checked all bank accounts (last 3 months)
- [ ] Checked all credit cards (last 3 months)
- [ ] Reviewed iOS/Android app subscriptions
- [ ] Searched email for subscription keywords
- [ ] Reviewed password manager accounts
- [ ] Checked PayPal/Venmo for recurring payments
- [ ] Added all found subscriptions to budget template
- [ ] Calculated total monthly subscription costs
- [ ] Calculated total annual subscription costs
- [ ] Identified subscriptions to cancel (unused/low value)

---

## 💡 PRO TIPS

1. **Be Thorough**: Check ALL accounts - subscriptions hide everywhere
2. **Don't Skip Small Ones**: $5/month = $60/year adds up
3. **Check Expired Too**: Some "expired" subscriptions still charge
4. **Look for Annual Charges**: Check full year of statements for annual subscriptions
5. **Investigate Unknown Charges**: If you see a charge you don't recognize, investigate it
6. **Check Family Plans**: If you're on a family plan, note your portion of cost
7. **Free Trials**: Check if any free trials converted to paid subscriptions

---

## 🚨 RED FLAGS (Investigate These!)

If you see these, investigate immediately:
- Charges from services you don't recognize
- Charges you thought you canceled
- Charges that seem too high
- Multiple charges from same service (might be duplicate)
- Charges from services you haven't used in months

---

## 📝 NEXT STEPS

After completing this checklist:

1. **Add all subscriptions** to BUDGET_AUDIT_TEMPLATE.md
2. **Mark each as Keep/Cancel/Review**
3. **Calculate total costs** (monthly and annual)
4. **Use SUBSCRIPTION_CANCELLATION_GUIDE.md** to cancel unused ones
5. **Update quarterly** - new subscriptions creep in!

---

**Remember**: Missing just a few $10/month subscriptions = $360/year wasted. Be thorough!
