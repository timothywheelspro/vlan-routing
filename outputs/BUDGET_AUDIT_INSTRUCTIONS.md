### Phase 2: Fill Out Template (Day 3)

1. Open `BUDGET_AUDIT_TEMPLATE.md`
2. Systematically fill in each section:
   - Start with income (easiest)
   - Then fixed expenses (most predictable)
   - Then variable expenses (estimate based on past 3 months average)
   - Then subscriptions (be thorough - check everything)
   - Then NSF/bank fees

3. **Be Honest**: Include everything, even small amounts

### Phase 3: Analysis (Day 4)

#### Option A: Use Python Script
1. Create `budget_data.json` file based on the structure in `budget_analyzer.py`

3. Review the generated `budget_analysis_report.txt`

#### Option B: Manual Analysis
1. Calculate totals in each category
2. Compare income vs expenses
3. Identify subscriptions to cancel (unused or low-value)
4. Calculate buffer needs for each account

## Buffer Calculation Guide

### Primary Checking Account
- **Target**: 1.5-2x monthly expenses
- **Example**: If monthly expenses = $3,000, buffer = $4,500-$6,000
- **Purpose**: Prevents NSF fees, covers unexpected expenses

### Emergency Savings
- **Target**: 3-6 months of expenses
- **Example**: If monthly expenses = $3,000, emergency fund = $9,000-$18,000
- **Purpose**: Major emergencies, job loss, unexpected large expenses

### Business Account
- **Target**: 1 month of business expenses
- **Purpose**: Business cash flow management, prevents business-related NSF fees

## Questions to Ask Yourself

For each subscription:
- When did I last use this?
- Could I live without this for 30 days?
- Is there a free alternative?
- Could I share this with family/friends?
- Is the annual plan cheaper than monthly?

For each expense:
- Is this essential or discretionary?
- Can I negotiate a lower rate?
- Is there a cheaper alternative?
- Can I reduce the frequency?

For account management:
- When do I get paid?
- When are my bills due?
- How much buffer do I need?
- Am I checking my balance regularly?

**Remember**: The goal is not deprivation, but optimization. You're creating a system that prevents fees, reduces stress, and gives you control over your finances.
