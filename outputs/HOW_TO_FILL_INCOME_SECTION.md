**Time Required**: 15-30 minutes  
**Documents Needed**: Pay stubs, bank statements, tax documents (if available)

---

## 🎯 Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Gather Your Documents (5 minutes)

Collect the following:
- [ ] **Pay stubs** - Last 3 months (shows regular paychecks)
- [ ] **Bank statements** - Last 3 months (shows deposits)
- [ ] **1099 forms** (if freelance/contractor) - Last year
- [ ] **W-2 forms** (if employee) - Last year
- [ ] **Side income records** - Freelance, gig work, etc.
- [ ] **Other income** - Investments, rental income, etc.

### Step 2: Identify All Income Sources (10 minutes)

List every source of money that comes in regularly:

#### Primary Income Sources:
- [ ] **Employment salary/wages** - Your main job
- [ ] **Hourly wages** - If paid hourly
- [ ] **Freelance/contract work** - 1099 income
- [ ] **Business income** - If you own a business

#### Secondary Income Sources:
- [ ] **Side jobs/gig work** - Uber, DoorDash, etc.
- [ ] **Part-time job** - Second job income
- [ ] **Investment income** - Dividends, interest
- [ ] **Rental income** - Property rental

- [ ] **VA benefits** - Disability, education, etc.
- [ ] **Unemployment** - If currently receiving
- [ ] **Child support/alimony** - If receiving
- [ ] **Other regular income** - List anything else

### Step 3: Calculate Monthly Income (10-15 minutes)

#### For Regular Paychecks (Bi-weekly, Semi-monthly, Weekly):

**Bi-weekly (every 2 weeks = 26 paychecks/year):**
```
Monthly Income = (Paycheck Amount × 26) ÷ 12

Example: $2,000 bi-weekly paycheck
Monthly = ($2,000 × 26) ÷ 12 = $52,000 ÷ 12 = $4,333.33/month
```

**Semi-monthly (twice per month = 24 paychecks/year):**
```
Monthly Income = Paycheck Amount × 2

Example: $2,500 semi-monthly paycheck
Monthly = $2,500 × 2 = $5,000/month
```

**Weekly (every week = 52 paychecks/year):**
```
Monthly Income = (Weekly Pay × 52) ÷ 12

Example: $1,000 weekly paycheck
Monthly = ($1,000 × 52) ÷ 12 = $52,000 ÷ 12 = $4,333.33/month
```

**Monthly (once per month):**
```
Monthly Income = Paycheck Amount

Example: $5,000 monthly paycheck
Monthly = $5,000/month
```

#### For Irregular Income (Freelance, Gig Work):

**Option 1: Average Last 3-6 Months**
```
Monthly Average = Sum of last 3-6 months ÷ Number of months

Example:
Month 1: $3,000
Month 2: $2,500
Month 3: $3,500
Average = ($3,000 + $2,500 + $3,500) ÷ 3 = $3,000/month
```

**Option 2: Conservative Estimate**
- Use the LOWEST month from past 6 months
- This prevents overestimating income

### Step 4: Fill Out the Template

Open `BUDGET_AUDIT_TEMPLATE.md` and locate the **INCOME ANALYSIS** section.

#### Section A: Monthly Income Sources

Fill in this table:

**Tips for filling it out:**

## 📊 Income Calculation Examples

### Example 1: Salaried Employee

**Situation:**
- Salary: $75,000/year
- Paid: Semi-monthly (24 paychecks)
- Take-home after taxes/insurance: $2,400 per paycheck

**Calculation:**
```
Monthly Income = $2,400 × 2 = $4,800/month
Annual Income = $4,800 × 12 = $57,600/year (after taxes)
```

**Template Entry:**
```
| Source | Amount | Frequency | Notes |
|--------|--------|-----------|-------|
| Software Engineer | $4,800 | Semi-monthly | After taxes, health, 401k |
| **TOTAL MONTHLY INCOME** | **$4,800** | | |
```

### Example 2: Hourly Worker + Side Gig

**Situation:**
- Full-time job: $25/hour, 40 hours/week
- Paid: Weekly
- Take-home: $750/week after taxes
- Side gig (Uber): Averages $300/week
- Take-home from Uber: $250/week (after gas/expenses)

**Calculation:**
```
Full-time monthly = ($750 × 52) ÷ 12 = $3,250/month
Side gig monthly = ($250 × 52) ÷ 12 = $1,083/month
Total = $3,250 + $1,083 = $4,333/month
```

**Template Entry:**
```
| Source | Amount | Frequency | Notes |
|--------|--------|-----------|-------|
| Warehouse Job | $3,250 | Weekly | After taxes, 40 hrs/week |
| Uber Driving | $1,083 | Weekly | Average after gas/expenses |
| **TOTAL MONTHLY INCOME** | **$4,333** | | |
```

### Example 3: Freelancer with Variable Income

**Situation:**
- Freelance designer
- Last 6 months: $2,000, $3,500, $2,800, $4,200, $3,000, $3,200
- Very irregular, but generally increasing

**Calculation:**
```
Average = ($2,000 + $3,500 + $2,800 + $4,200 + $3,000 + $3,200) ÷ 6
Average = $18,700 ÷ 6 = $3,117/month
```

**Use conservative estimate:** Use $3,000/month (rounded down)

**Template Entry:**
```
| Source | Amount | Frequency | Notes |
|--------|--------|-----------|-------|
| Freelance Design | $3,000 | Monthly | Average of last 6 months, conservative |
| **TOTAL MONTHLY INCOME** | **$3,000** | | |
```

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ Mistake 1: Using Gross (Before-Tax) Income
**Wrong:** "I make $75,000/year, so $6,250/month"  
**Right:** Use take-home pay after taxes, insurance, 401k deductions

**How to find take-home:**
- Look at your bank deposit (what actually hits your account)
- Check pay stub "Net Pay" or "Take Home" line
- Don't use "Gross Pay"

### ❌ Mistake 2: Overestimating Variable Income
**Wrong:** "I made $5,000 last month from freelancing, so I'll use that"  
**Right:** Average several months, or use a conservative (low) estimate

**Why it matters:** If you budget based on your best month, you'll be short when you have a bad month.

### ❌ Mistake 3: Counting Uncertain Income
**Wrong:** "I might get a $5,000 bonus, so I'll include it"  
**Right:** Only count income you're CERTAIN will happen

**Rule:** If it's not guaranteed, don't count it. If it happens, it's a bonus you can save or use for debt.

### ❌ Mistake 4: Forgetting About Deductions
**Wrong:** "My salary is $60,000, so $5,000/month"  
**Right:** Account for taxes, health insurance, 401k, etc.

**Tip:** Your bank statement shows the real number - use that!

### ❌ Mistake 5: Including Business Revenue Instead of Profit
**Wrong:** "My business makes $10,000/month in revenue"  
**Right:** Use profit after business expenses

**For business owners:** Income = Revenue - Business Expenses

## ✅ Verification Checklist

After filling out the income section, verify:

- [ ] All income sources listed
- [ ] Using AFTER-TAX amounts (take-home pay)
- [ ] Monthly amounts calculated correctly
- [ ] Notes explain how you calculated each amount
- [ ] Total matches what you actually see in your bank account
- [ ] Not counting uncertain/one-time income as monthly
- [ ] Variable income averaged or estimated conservatively

### Quick Verification Test:

**Does your monthly income total match what you see in your bank account?**

Add up all deposits to your checking account over the past 3 months, then divide by 3. This should be close to your calculated monthly income (within 5-10%).

```
Example:
Month 1 deposits: $7,200
Month 2 deposits: $7,100
Month 3 deposits: $7,300
Average: ($7,200 + $7,100 + $7,300) ÷ 3 = $7,200/month

Your calculated income should be around $7,200/month
```

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Be Conservative**: It's better to underestimate income than overestimate
2. **Use Bank Deposits**: Your bank statement shows the real number - trust it
3. **Review Quarterly**: Income can change - update this section quarterly
4. **Separate Business Income**: If you have a business, keep business and personal income separate
5. **Track Separately**: Track "guaranteed" income vs "variable" income - helps with planning

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Should I include my tax refund as monthly income?**  
A: No, it's one-time. Include it in the "Annual/One-Time Income" section, not monthly.

**Q: My hours vary - how do I calculate monthly income?**  
A: Average your last 3-6 months of take-home pay. Be conservative (use the lower months).

**Q: I'm self-employed - gross revenue or profit?**  
A: Use PROFIT (revenue minus business expenses). Your personal income is what you pay yourself.

**Q: Should I include investment gains?**  
A: Only if they're regular and reliable (like dividend payments). Don't include stock market gains unless you're regularly selling.

**Q: My spouse and I have separate accounts - do I include their income?**  
A: Only if you're doing a combined household budget. If separate finances, only include your own income.

**Q: I get paid bi-weekly - why is the calculation different?**  
A: Bi-weekly = every 2 weeks = 26 paychecks/year (not 24). Two months per year you get 3 paychecks instead of 2, which is why you divide by 12 instead of multiplying by 2.
