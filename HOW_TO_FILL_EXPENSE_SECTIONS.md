Average: ($420 + $380 + $400) ÷ 3 = $400/month
```

1. **Bank statements** - Look for recurring charges

3. **App stores** - iOS Settings → Subscriptions, Google Play Subscriptions

5. **Fill in subscription table** - Be thorough!

### Step 4: Calculate Totals (10 minutes)

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ Mistake 1: Forgetting Annual/Quarterly Expenses
**Wrong:** Only counting monthly expenses  
**Right:** Divide annual expenses by 12, quarterly by 3

**Example:** Property tax $2,400/year = $200/month

### ❌ Mistake 2: Not Averaging Variable Expenses
**Wrong:** Using just one month's grocery bill  
**Right:** Average 3-6 months

**Why:** Expenses vary month to month - averaging gives accurate picture

### ❌ Mistake 3: Missing Hidden Subscriptions
**Wrong:** Only counting obvious subscriptions  
**Right:** Check ALL accounts, app stores, email

**Common missed:** App subscriptions, cloud storage, domain renewals, software subscriptions

### ❌ Mistake 4: Double-Counting Expenses
**Wrong:** Counting insurance deducted from paycheck AND as separate expense  
**Right:** Only count it once (usually as reduction in take-home pay, not as expense)

### ❌ Mistake 5: Not Including All Accounts
**Wrong:** Only checking primary checking account  
**Right:** Check ALL accounts (checking, savings, all credit cards, PayPal, etc.)

### ❌ Mistake 6: Using "Ideal" Instead of "Actual"
**Wrong:** "I should spend $300/month on groceries"  
**Right:** Use what you ACTUALLY spent (average of last 3 months)

**Why:** Budget based on reality, not goals. Goals come later in planning phase.

## ✅ Verification Checklist

After filling out all expense sections:

- [ ] All sections filled out
- [ ] Fixed expenses match bank statements
- [ ] Variable expenses are averaged (3+ months)
- [ ] Annual expenses divided by 12
- [ ] Quarterly expenses divided by 3
- [ ] Subscriptions thoroughly checked (all accounts)
- [ ] All accounts reviewed (checking, savings, credit cards)
- [ ] No expenses double-counted
- [ ] Totals calculated correctly
- [ ] Notes explain how amounts were calculated

### Quick Verification Test:

**Does your total monthly expenses match your spending?**

Add up all withdrawals from your checking account over the past 3 months, divide by 3. This should be close to your calculated expenses (within 10-15% is reasonable due to variable expenses).

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: What if I can't find a bill amount?**  
A: Estimate based on similar months, or contact the company. Better to estimate than skip.

**Q: Should I include savings/investments as expenses?**  
A: No, those are transfers to yourself. Include in a separate "savings" section if tracking.

**Q: What about one-time expenses?**  
A: Only include if they're regular (like annual fees). True one-time expenses go in a separate category.

**Q: How do I handle shared expenses (with roommate/spouse)?**  
A: Only include your portion. If you pay $600 rent and split with roommate, include $300 if they reimburse you, or $600 if you pay it all.

**Q: What if expenses vary a lot month to month?**  
A: Average more months (6 months instead of 3) for more accuracy. Or use the highest month as worst-case planning.

**Q: Should I include taxes as an expense?**  
A: No, if using after-tax income (take-home pay). Taxes are already deducted. If using gross income, then include taxes.
